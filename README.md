To run your Node.js project locally, you can follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run npm install to install all the dependencies listed in your package.json file.

Start the Server: If your package.json file has a start script, you can start your server with the command npm start. The start script usually looks something like this:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node server/index.js"
}

In this case, node server/index.js starts your server. If your start script is different, adjust the command accordingly.

Open the Application: If your server is set up to run on a specific port (like 3000), you can open your application in a web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.
Remember to check the console for any error messages if your application isn't working. These can provide clues about what's going wrong.
